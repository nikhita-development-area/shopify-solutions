Throughout school and college I was blessed with good hair but after being diagnosed with covid in early 2021, I noticed that I had lost a good chunk of my hair at the crown and front section of my head. After reaching out to Traya ( came across them via Instagram ) I took the plunge. Had a long conversation with Raveena (the hair specialist\/ doctor assigned to me) and we found out that i was in stage 4 of hair loss and this worried me considerably. Raveena assured me that this issue can be reversed and new hair can grow back in the affected areas. Fast forward to 6 months... Followed the diet and medication strictly and all that Raveena had mentioned was true. Really happy with the outcome. Thank you Traya & Raveena.",

After filling Traya’s form, I got call from the team. The team cleared my doubts and I enrolled for the treatment on December, 2021. I received my 1st month kit and got assigned to Hair Coach, Mr. Nihal, who is clear in providing instructions and open to address all sorts of questions. I could literally see new hair growing at the borders of my forehead and the density of the hair was getting thicker. Throughout this process, I learnt that hair health is just the reflection of our health and lifestyle (genetic traits and chronic diseases are exception). Missing of essential nutrients in our diet, physical activity and lack of sound sleep are directly connected to hair loss which alarms us to get in track to fix that. No imported hair oil or expensive shampoo can fix that.",

I was losing hair due to stress and other things, but they analysed everything perfectly and had sent my treatment plan and diet plan. In my 1st use itself I could find some difference and after 1 month I saw visible changes in my hair. Kudos to the staff at Traya health for having excellent professionalism as they check on us frequently regarding our issues and concerns.
