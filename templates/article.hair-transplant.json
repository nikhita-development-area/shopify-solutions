Particularly, if your hair loss has advanced beyond the 5th stage of the Norwood Scale of Hair Loss, a transplant may be necessary. However, for hair loss that hasn't progressed to this stage, exploring natural treatment options and making lifestyle adjustments can greatly improve your chances of hair regrowth and enhancement, enabling you to avoid invasive procedures.<\/p>"

During implantation, the surgeon creates tiny incisions in the balding or thinning areas of your scalp.
