I have oily dandruff, which was causing a lot of hair fall, but I am happy to report, as of 16th December 2021, my hair fall is negligible, and my hair is shiny even after using hair colour. I am impressed by the persistent follow-ups and personalised experience. Great job Traya, and thank you, Sakshi :)<\/p>"

She has been helping me since the time I took the scalp analysis. Traya worked wonders on my hair. I was losing hair due to stress and other things, but they analysed everything perfectly and had sent my treatment plan and diet plan. In my 1st use itself I could find some difference and after 1 month I saw visible changes in my hair. Kudos to the staff at Traya health for having excellent professionalism as they check on us frequently regarding our issues and concerns. After I started seeing great results, my cousin and my brother also have started using Traya recently. Once again thankyou Traya health and Raveena( you are wonderful) for such amazing help  <\/p>"
